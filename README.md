# Pizza-Sales-Report---SQL-Project
ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform business-focused data analysis using **SQL** on a pizza sales dataset. 
The goal is to uncover key insights about revenue, bestsellers, category performance, and time-based sales trends that can inform business decisions.

The dataset is provided in CSV format and simulates a relational database structure. All analysis is done by importing these CSV files into a SQL database.

The data is spread across four CSV files representing the following tables:

 **orders.csv**
 
 **order_details.csv**

 **pizzas.csv**
 
 **pizza_type.csv**
